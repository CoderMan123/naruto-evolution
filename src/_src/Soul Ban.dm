//////////////////////////////
//////////////////////////////
Alright, so this is my first library,
so feel free to comment about any concerns
you might have on the hub.

Soul Ban is free to use and modify by anyone.
The only conditions I'd request is that you don't
claim to have created anything found within this
library. A mention somewhere in your projects credits
would bethoughtful, but is not required.

V1.0.0
	10/02/2012 - Created the basic ban system. Includes the base project and all Ban/Unban verbs and the Ban Check verb.
V1.0.1
	10/02/2012 - Fixed a small bug that I didn't catch before release that prevented people from being unbanned.
V1.0.2
	*Note* You may need to wipe your ServerBanList savefile to be compatable with this new version.
	10/02/2012 - Made several big changes in the library to make it so that there's only one list and one datum container for all bans.
	10/02/2012 - When checking for bans it will only loop once now rather than once for each ban type.
V1.0.3
	10/10/2012 - Fixed a bug that prevented more bans from being added after the first one.
V1.0.4
	10/10/2012 - Minor code tweaks.
	11/19/2012 - Fixed a few minor bugs that were found.
