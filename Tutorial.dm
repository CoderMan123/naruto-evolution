inform you of every action you do, and anyone around you does. Important events and news will appear in this window. From there, there are a number
of buttons that you can explore yourselves, each doing a different thing, and all easily understandable by their name. Please move on to the next Jounin."},"[src]")

using attacks coupled with a target, will increase your effectiveness."},"[src]")

fighting. This can help you track and hit your target more often than if you were not targetting. If you choose your speciality to be strength, you will notice an bonus given
towards your strength stat, and the ability to do combos emerges. Combos increase your damage, and allow you to throw kicks and punches towards your opponent faster than a normal
ninja would be able to. You can train your strength and Strength skills whilst in combat, or hone them up on logs. The logs in the Dojos will not reward as much experience as those outside, however. Anywho! That should wrap up the basics of strength, please move on to the next Jounin."},"[src]")

roles in a Naruto game. They're probably right, because it does indeed play a large role! In [_worldName] you must first learn techniques via the skill tree, found on the lower bar of the screen. Once you have learned a technique
you can then read the handsigns by clicking the 'Jutsus' tab on the same bar. Using the macros displayed next to the technique, you can preform the jutsu, and execute it by pressing the spacebar. Eventually, you will be able to macro these techniques
and be able to add them to your hotslot bar. Once you have used the technique 100 times, you will be able to press P, and drag it on dow nto your hotbar where you can use it at will. Another important factor in
training Ninjutsu is the levels each technique has. Most techniques will have a mastery level, and it will influence the technique in certain ways depending on it's level. Through using this technique, you will be able to increase your mastery level, and preform
the technique much greater than others."},"[src]")

Although most would prefer training in the Dojos, or using logs-- there are many other factors that come into play when playing. You could do missions to gather rewards, or even team up with a squad.
Using a combination of missions and squads, will allow you to gain much more experience than others. "},"[src]")

on if you use them. Another important aspect is PVP. However PVP is much more enforced than on other games, and you could get struck down by enemy shinobi, or even your own village shinobi if you act out!
NPC guardians are at every village in the game, and they're just waiting to pounce on aggressors-- so watch out who you attack! This should wrap up the tutorial for now. Head on out those doors to proceed into the
real world. Here's a refresher book, should you ever forget what we taught you. In order to proceed through the doors of this tutorial, you will have to take down one Rogue Shinobi-- they await you outside these doors."},"[src]")
